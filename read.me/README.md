# Password Generator

## This website serves to randomly generate characters to create a unique password based off of the users inputs.

What motivated me to complete this project wasn't just a good grade, but I feel as though the vast majority of people I know have rather simplistic passwords.

I think this solves the problem of having to think of a new password anytime you would like to make an account for something.

I learned how to make a random number generator and learned more about for loops.

Follow the prompts to make a new passwords and select the chracters you would like to include.
