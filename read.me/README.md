# Password Generator

## This website serves to randomly generate characters to create a unique password based off of the users inputs.

What motivated me to complete this project wasn't just a good grade, but I feel as though the vast majority of people I know have rather simplistic passwords.

I think this solves the problem of having to think of a new password anytime you would like to make an account for something.

I learned how to make a random number generator and learned more about for loops.

Follow the prompts to make a new passwords and select the chracters you would like to include.

I looked back at my code an tried to make things unique by using pre randomized functions instead of arrays, but I hit roadblocks. I then decided to try to backtrack and revamp my prior code, but I hit another roadblock. I would appreciate some input on what I did wrong.

I also had a very hard time when it came to the for loops and min max methods.
